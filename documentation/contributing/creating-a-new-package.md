# Creating a new package in Loom

To generate a new package in this codebase, simply run:

```
$ yarn generate:package
```

This will prompt you with a few questions to setup the inital boilerplate. We use [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) to scaffold out a new package. If you notice any issues with the scaffolded pacakge, please submit a PR to update the template files in the `templates` directory.
